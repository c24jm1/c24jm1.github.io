	<p id = "entryfont"> Ugh I'm SO CLOSE to finishing my cryptification codesketch so I mainly worked on that instead of a new codesketch. If I start a new codesketch, I won't get it done for a while. I can't really think of any ideas besides the timer one(see end of this entry). Anyways, in regards to the cryptification codesketch, I just need to make sure that I don't use Array.from() on numbers in a string anymore. Also, I'm trying to make it so caps and numbers/symbols can be used. I think I'll have to mark down the index, take care of them, and then add them back in at the end. Once I finish that, I want to make a timer. I would probably use setInterval for that, but honestly I don't know. </p>
	<p id = "headings"> Entry 3(Nov 15, 2020)</p>
	<p id = "entryfont"> I'm having trouble taking my array and translating every element in it to a number. I'm trying to use array.indexOf but that isn't working. Also, I want to make my website look better but I'm not sure how. It looks boring right now. </p>
	<p id = "headings"> Entry 2(Nov 1, 2020)</p>
	<p id = "entryfont"> Making my website was really fun! I wasn't really sure how I wanted it to look, so I'm pretty happy with the results right now. Obviously, I need to make it look better because the home page is very empty, and I want to have something next to the top bar where it says "Julia's coding website," but other than that, I'm very happy with how it turned out. Once I got past the actual specifics on how to do it, it was fun.</p>
	<p id = "headings">Entry 1 (Oct 19,2020)</p>
	<p id = "entryfont">So far in CS1, I’ve made my person card and a random codesketch that I combined with a codesketch-in-progress. I’ve learned how to tag in CSS, and I’ve learned how to style and format things. Naming things and not confusing the tags with variables has been a little tricky and frustrating. It was unexpected that we can mix in Java into the CSS. I’m feeling pretty good about everything so far, though. Labs have been going really well, and going forward, I want to finish my codesketch(I’m not sure if I have to specify, but I want to debug it so it does the basic thing I want it to right now, and then I want to make it a little more complicated so it encrypts longer strings rather than just a letter) so I can work on more projects. </p>
